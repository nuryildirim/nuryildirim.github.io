I'm a fifth year PhD student at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm advised by [John Zimmerman](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/john-zimmerman){:target="_blank"} and [James McCann](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jmccann/){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on supporting cross-functional teams in envisioning AI products and experiences. I develop resources and innovation processes to (1) support more effective collaboration at the ideation and problem formulation stages of a project; (2) sensitize teams to AI capabilities, limitations, and risks; and (3) help teams more fully explore the problem-solution space before selecting what to implement. I leverage participatory approaches, such as design thinking and facilitation, to help teams identify strong matches between existing AI capabilities and actual needs, while simultaneously assessing each idea‚Äôs latent risks.

I spent two wonderful summers working as a research intern at Google Research and Microsoft Research in Cambridge, MA and Cambridge, UK respectively. Before Carnegie Mellon, I worked as a design consultant in the industry for over 7 years, designing products ranging from medical to consumer electronics, assistive robots, transportation and toys. I received my master's and bachelor's in Industrial Design from [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"} in Turkey.


My current projects include:
------
* **AI Design Sprints:** Envisioning novel AI-enabled products and experiences is challenging. How can innovation teams ``sketch'' and ideate AI experiences broadly to discover low-risk, high-effort concepts in the early stages of AI product development? I am working with industry partners to facilitate AI Design Sprints within cross-functional product teams. If you'd like to set up a sprint at your organization, shoot me an email!
